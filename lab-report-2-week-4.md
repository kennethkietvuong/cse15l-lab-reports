# Lab Report 2 - Week 4 (Incremental Development & Debugging)

Hey y'all! This is the second lab report for CSE 15L. This is all about the concept and uses of ***incremental development*** with the addition of ***debugging***.

The main focus in incremental development is to do things *"one step at a time"*, where you would make a few changes and review those changes (*aka debugging*) before moving on to the next task or thing you will do.

This way, you won't have to worry about destroying or messing up your entire program in one go.
