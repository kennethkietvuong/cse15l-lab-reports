Alrighty, hey guys! This is the fourth lab report for CSE 15L. There aren't any new concepts that are game-changing that will be discussed this time, but it's all about **refining** and **cleaning** up your code.

What does **cleaning up your code** mean? In short, it means to make your code ***more easy to read and understand***. In the efforts of making your code more better, it's not all about adding more safety measures to make sure your code works, but rather to make the code more *satisfying* and *appealing* to people who do want to *peruse* your code.

Simply, ***clean code is code that clearly displays its intended purpose and that is is simple.***

Below, I will test 3 snippets to another person's implementation and my own implementation of `MarkdownParse.java`.
